# Falcon.Chat Server

Client Respository URL: https://github.com/justiceserv/FalconChatClient

### Developed by @SaintRobotal @justiceserv

## Prerequisites 

If you want to build .jar file and modify source code, you need Netbeans IDE (from oracle, not apache)

If you want to just use our pre-built .jarfile locally, just download it, and it will work just fine. 

## Functions 
- MD5 Encryption on password (in server)
- Basic chat functions (Add friend, Send message) 
- Port based chatting between server and client. 
- Save Chatting logs and friend in local client. 

This program was for our last semester java final project, and it does not have much functions. 

If we try to develop this project again, we will try these functions. 
- HTTP based chatting system 
- All chatting logs are stored in Server with AES-128 or stronger encryption method. 
- Opus Codec based voice chat. 
- Tags that will discriminate users with same username.
